To install MPFI library :

./configure extra options (read INSTALL for general options)

--with-gmp=<gmp installation directory>

IMPORTANT:
Note that default installation path is /usr/local/lib.
If you configured MPFI with --prefix=some/path or if you are using a system
like Debian, the library may not be found at running time.

If you compile a soft using mpfi and have an error at execution time such as:

error while loading shared libraries: libmpfi.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

try adding /some/path (or /usr/local/lib in the case of Debian) to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
