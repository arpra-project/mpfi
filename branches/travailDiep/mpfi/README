To install MPFI library :

./configure extra options (read INSTALL for general options)

--with-gmp-dir=<gmp installation directory>

Note that default install path is /usr/local/lib.
Systems like Debian do not search libraries at this place by default.
If you compile a soft using mpfi and have an error at execution time such as:

error while loading shared libraries: libmpfi.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

try adding /usr/local/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Trying something.
