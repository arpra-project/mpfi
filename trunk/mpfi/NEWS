Changes between MPFI version 1.0 and 1.1

* GNU autoconf/automake standards
* mpfi-impl.h (non exported internal macros)


Changes between MPFI version 1.1 and 1.3.4-RC3

* unknown history


Changes between MPFI 1.3.4-RC3 and 1.4

* bugfixes for trigonometric functions
* add compilation for a shared library

Changes between MPFI version 1.4 and 1.5

* new functions : Catalan's constant, cubic root, reciprocal square root,
  secant, cosecant, cotangent and hyperbolic counterparts, atan2, hypot,
  get_version, urandom
* new test suite (99.2% LOC)
* can now be compiled outside the source directory
* change configure options to be consistent with the ones in MPFR and MPC:
  --with-gmp-dir=DIR changed to --with-gmp=DIR
  --with-gmp-libpath=DIR changed to --with-gmp-lib=DIR
  --with-gmp-incpath=DIR changed to --with-gmp-include=DIR
  --with-mpfr-dir=DIR changed to --with-mpfr=DIR
  --with-mpfr-libpath=DIR changed to --with-mpfr-lib=DIR
  --with-mpfr-incpath=DIR changed to --with-mpfr-include=DIR
* now require at least GMP version 4.1.0 and MPFR version 2.4.0
* each function is in its own file (compile_time *= 8;)
* remove limitation to 1000 characters in mpfi_set_str.
* fix documentation for functions mpfi_blow, mpfi_is_inside
* fix bug in mpfi_ui_sub when reusing a variable (bug reported by
  Sisyphus 2010-01-19).
* fix bug in mpfi_blow: the result could be underestimated when the factor was
  small compared to 1.
* the following functions now return 0 (false) if one or more of their
  operands is NaN or has a NaN as an endpoint : mpfi_is_inside,
  mpfi_is_inside_d, mpfi_is_inside_ui, mpfi_is_inside_si, mpfi_is_inside_z,
  mpfi_is_inside_q, mpfi_is_inside_fr, mpfi_is_pos, mpfi_is_strictly_pos,
  mpfi_is_nonneg, mpfi_is_neg, mpfi_is_strictly_neg, mpfi_is_nonpos,
  mpfi_inf_p, mpfi_bounded_p
